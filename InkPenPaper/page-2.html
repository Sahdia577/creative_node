<h1>Comics To 'Heavy' Literature</h1>
<p>Reading isn't just for bookish people. It's for everyone who might pass time during commuting, reading 
a detective or perhaps historical fiction during a holiday. 
A comic book isn't less than a novel. Non-fiction is as good a read as fiction. 
You can't do reading wrong. Knowing your abc is all you need.  
Just open a page and start reading. Enjoy.</p>
