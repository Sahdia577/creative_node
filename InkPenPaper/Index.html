<h1>Travelling through the diverse worlds between books</h1>
<p>I love reading different genres of books, especially mixed genres. One of my favourite fictional characters is Flavia de Luce.
This book series is a combination of historical fiction, mysteries and detective stories.
Although I haven't read these books in ages, pieces of the series are still in my head and I haven't forgotten Flavia.
I will reread these books again one day. </p>
<p>Reading allows you to understand different viewpoints, as you are taken into the headspace of a character. This helps understanding people in real life. 
However, reading isn't only understanding the world around you or just entertainment, it can be an escape from real life too. Go on, open that book 
and forget about the coffee you accidentally (really?) spilled on your boss or that difficult test result which you will only find out about tomorrow.</p>
