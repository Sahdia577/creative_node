<h3>You Don't Need Canonical Book Lists</h3>
<p>You can throw the must-read-book-lists away and choose something you really want to read. 
Ask yourself what topics you like. If you don't care about historical topics at all, you might want to leave
historical fiction alone.
Do you like a good laugh or would you rather read a biography? Not mutually exclusive of course.</p>

<h4>These are some of my favourite books:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Time Regained (Marcel Proust)</li>
<li>The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde)</li>
<li>To The Lighthouse (Virginia Woolf)</li>
<li>Northanger Abbey (Jane Austen)</li>
<li>De Drieling series (Trix van Brussel)</li>
<li>The Historian (Elizabeth Kostova)</li>
<li>Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell (Susanna Clarke)</li>
<li>Me Talk Pretty One Day (David Sedaris)</li>
</ul>
    
<p>As you see, they come from different genres. I like a good laugh, but am also interested in history and enjoy reading about languages.<br />
And of course, I'm always in for a good mystery or even a scary story.</p>
<p>How about you? What are your interests? Think about what you like and then find a book in that genre. </p>
